# Simon-Game
My name is Eric Quispe, this for software development I, [202410-CEN-3024C-16046]

After the class ended I wanted to use some of the concepts I learned about GUI and threads to make this games. The function is to play just like a Regular game of Simon, press the color pattern it you see.
