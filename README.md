# Simon-Game
My name is Eric Quispe, this for software development I, [202410-CEN-3024C-16046]

After the class ended I wanted to use some of the concepts I learned about GUI and threads in cop2805 to make this games. The function is to play just like a Regular game of Simon, press the color pattern it you see. 

click the start button once and try to follow that simon picks. ( its not error proof all the way. dont click the start button twice, the game counts all the things simon enters so say you were given 5 colors, than you need to enter 5 guess. It wont say you were wrong or right till you clicked 5 guesses. if your wrong you will see a flash of all the boxes. If your right the level counter will increase and a new color pattern will be added.
